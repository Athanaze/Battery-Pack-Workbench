## Usage on non-manjaro platforms/distros : bugs, errors

I only use manjaro so you might get some errors concerning the path of scripts, assets, etc... or other issues when running this addon on other platforms/distros. If you are able to fix those, I would happily include the fixes in the project.

+ All data as of Sep. 18. 2020

Note: I have not checked every values in this spreadsheets, so I recommend always checking with the producer's datasheets. The main function of these spreadsheets is to provide autocomplete and a rough idea of weight and performance. There are prices and link to sellers for some parts. I am not in any way associated with these sellers (maybe the creator of the spreadsheets is ?). I kept the informations in to give a rough idea of the price.

"Note: Max values are only possible at ideal temperatures (5 to 45°C). Esp. low temperatures (-20 to 5°C) can drastically reduce performance. If only one value is given, consider it Max."
